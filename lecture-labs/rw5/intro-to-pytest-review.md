# Class Review

Overall the lab today went fine, alot of the documentation was slightly off as far as missing a step to cd into tests
in one of the commands, another issue was some of the functions I was supposed to be changing I assumed were files because
they were not tagged with () at the end of the function. 

Some of the terminology has stuck but I will be doing more research on my own after class - 

I am slowly understanding the process of testing using pytest, and I think this was a good start in that direction. 

However for the homework I have never done anything with python or java so I would love any sort of guidance or tutorials if 
you have recommendations.
