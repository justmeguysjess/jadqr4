# Summary

I had some trouble in this assignment with pytests, I spent most of my time working on making sure all my syntax was correct
in order to be able to run my tests firstly, before running them with my functions I created. 

I plan to upload both the test files and the function files seperately

Please let me know if you have any questions, in case I did not submit this correctly.
